- 👽  Hi, I’m Berenice Llorens.
- 🌱 I’m developing an artistic research on musical composition and the transformations of the creative process according
  the perception of the environment we inhabit. I also explore in the fields of computer music, pure data and artificial inteligence.
- 👀 I’m interested in music, performance, ecology, and technology.
- 🎹 I make music, videoart, improvisations, collaborations, performances, podcasts, radioshow, among others.
- 🧭 I want to create sound installations using multichannel audio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interdiciplinaries and musical projects.
- 💎 I use a combination of practices, instruments, and tools to create my work. 
- 👁️‍🗨️ All of my projects are available at berenicellorens.com
